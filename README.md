Twiddler is a shallow Twitter frontend clone created with vanilla Javascript, jQuery, and CSS3.

## App Features

* Psuedo-tweets (twids) are generated periodically and can be viewed by scrolling down the feed. 
* Clicking the "update feed" button will add new twids to the feed.
* Clicking on a username will fill the feed with only that user's twids.
